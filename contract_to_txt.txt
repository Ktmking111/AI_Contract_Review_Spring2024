Prime Contract clauses flowed down to Seller are superior to and replace any conflicting language otherwise contained in this Agreement.
NONDISCLOSURE.
Confidential Information. It is contemplated that the disclosing Party (“Disclosing Party”) may be disclosing certain confidential and/or proprietary information to the receiving Party (“Receiving Party”) unknown to the general public (hereinafter referred to as "Confidential Information"). The Parties agree the terms of this Article 16 shall apply to any confidential and/or proprietary information that may be disclosed under this Agreement, and that such Confidential Information shall be used solely for the benefit of the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party acknowledges the above-described Confidential Information is confidential and/or proprietary to the Disclosing Party and is claimed to be a valuable, special, and unique asset of the Disclosing Party.
Subject to the limitations set forth in Article 16.D. below, all non-public information exchanged between the Parties shall be deemed to be Confidential Information. In order for the Parties to appreciate when non-public information is being conveyed, to the reasonable extent possible, information disclosed in tangible form shall be clearly identified at the time of disclosure as being Confidential Information by an appropriate and conspicuous marking. Similarly, to the reasonable extent possible, information disclosed in intangible form (e.g., oral or visual) shall be identified as being Confidential Information at the time of
disclosure, and shall be confirmed as such in writing to the Receiving Party within 30 days after such disclosure.
Confidential Information shall include as examples, without limitation:
All information of a Disclosing Party which has been maintained as confidential, including draft publications, technical reports, research plans and results, processes, techniques, know-how, biological materials, computer source code, diagrams, electronic files, financial information, customer lists, trade secrets, invention disclosures, patent applications or test data; all existing and future plans of the Disclosing Party, which have been maintained as confidential, including plans relating to existing and planned products, research, development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, servicing, or financing; all past, present and future business or commercial relationships of the Disclosing Party, which have been maintained as confidential, including suppliers, service providers, clients, customers, employees, or investors; or information that has generally been considered and treated by the Disclosing Party as confidential prior to the time of disclosure and is clearly identified as “Confidential” or “Proprietary” when disclosed to the other Party.
Exclusions from Confidential Information: Confidential Information shall not be deemed to include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate by competent written proof:
is now, or hereafter becomes, publicly known or available through no act or failure to act on the part of the Receiving Party;
was known by the Receiving Party at the time of receipt of such information as evidenced by its records;
is hereafter furnished to the Receiving Party by a third party as a matter of right and without violating any confidentiality obligation to the Disclosing Party; or
was independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party without use or knowledge of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.
Use of Confidential Information: Each Party agrees it will use the Confidential Information of the other solely for the purposes of this Agreement and for no other purpose whatsoever. In particular, the Receiving Party shall not file any patent application containing any claim to subject matter derived in whole or in part from the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. The Confidential Information, including any documents, drawings, sketches, designs, materials or samples supplied hereunder, shall remain the property of the Party disclosing the same and no rights or licenses are granted to the other Party in the same, whether patented or not, except the limited right to use the Confidential Information as set forth above.
Confidential Obligations: For a period of five (5) years from the date any such Confidential Information is disclosed, the Parties agrees to exert reasonable efforts to maintain each other’s Confidential Information in confidence and to take all necessary and reasonable precautions to prevent its unauthorized disclosure and to ensure it does not fall into the public domain or the possession of unauthorized third parties. Each Party shall restrict access to the Confidential Information of the other Party to those officers, employees, consultants, agents, and students of the Receiving Party having a need to know the Confidential Information to fulfill the purposes of this Agreement, provided that each Party shall ensure that any individual having access to the Confidential Information is made expressly aware of the obligation of confidence according to the terms hereof prior to gaining access to the Confidential Information. To the extent that a Party perceives a need for disclosure of the Confidential Information it receives from the other Party to any third party, such third party shall be prospectively identified and written permission to disclose shall be obtained from Disclosing Party. A written non-disclosure agreement shall be obtained from the third party contractor and a copy shall be promptly provided to the Party whose Confidential Information is being disclosed.
Required Disclosure: If a Receiving Party is legally required by court order, law, or other governmental regulation or authority to disclose certain Confidential Information received from a Disclosing Party, such disclosure may be made only after giving written notice to the Disclosing Party and providing a reasonable opportunity for pursuit of appropriate process to prevent or limit such disclosure. In any event, required disclosure shall be limited to only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed. The Receiving Party is not, however, required to pursue any claim, defense, cause of action, or legal process or proceeding on the Disclosing Party’s behalf.
Return of Documents: It is understood that the Confidential Information disclosed by each Party shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. All material or documents furnished by the Disclosing Party, including all copies, shall upon request of the Disclosing Party, or in any event at the termination of this Agreement, be promptly returned to the Disclosing Party or destroyed, except the Receiving Party may securely retain one copy in its files solely for record purposes of its obligations under this Agreement.
Subject to the limitations set forth in Article 16.F. above, the provisions of this Article 16 shall survive the performance, completion, termination, or cancellation of the Agreement.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
“Intellectual Property” means all intellectual property, including without limitation, electronic or otherwise, technical information, know-how, copyrights, patents and
trade secrets, ideas, thoughts, concepts, processes, techniques, data, development tools, models, drawings, specifications, prototypes, inventions and software. Intellectual Property, as that term is used in this Agreement, also includes works of authorship that are subject to copyright protection under Chapters 1 through 8 of Title 17 of the United States Code.
“Project IP” or “Project Intellectual Property” shall mean all Intellectual Property that is authored or conceived and reduced to practice in the performance of this Agreement.
“Background Intellectual Property” means Intellectual Property owned or controlled by a Party as of the Effective Date, and any Intellectual Property a Party conceives, creates, develops, or otherwise acquires thereafter pursuant to activities independent of this Agreement.
Ownership of Project IP shall be as follows:
Title to any Project IP made or conceived solely by employees of Seller vests in Seller.
Title to any Project IP made or conceived solely by employees of Buyer vests in Buyer.
Title to any Project IP made or conceived jointly by employees of both Seller and Buyer (hereinafter called “Joint IP”) vests jointly in Seller and Buyer.
The Buyer shall have the first option to perfect the rights in jointly made or generated Project Intellectual Property unless otherwise agreed in writing.
To the extent not prohibited by other obligations, Auburn hereby grants Sponsor an option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license for a specific field(s) of use under Auburn's Intellectual Property rights arising from this Project which were made solely by Auburn or jointly by Auburn and Sponsor.  Sponsor’s option shall extend for a period not to exceed six (6) months after the expiration or termination of this Agreement.  Patent preparation, filing, and prosecution during the option period, if any, shall be at Sponsor's expense.  If Sponsor wishes to exercise its option hereunder, it shall so notify Auburn within the option period, and both parties shall negotiate in good faith the terms of the license within sixty (60) days following Sponsor’s exercise of its option, such period to be extended upon mutual written agreement of the parties.  If Auburn and Sponsor cannot agree upon the terms of the license within ninety (90) days thereafter, Auburn shall be free to license the Intellectual Property to any third party without further obligation to Sponsor.
Expenses and other liabilities associated with the development and marketing of any product, process, or other innovation employing Project Intellectual Property shall be negotiated between the parties in good faith within one (1) year after the date of termination of this Subcontract.
IP Disclosures. Seller shall disclose to Buyer, in writing, every Project Intellectual Property which may be patentable or otherwise protectable under the United States patent laws in Title 35, United States Code, in sufficient detail as to allow Buyer’s evaluation (“IP Disclosure(s)”). Any such IP Disclosure shall be considered Confidential Information and shall be marked as proprietary when disclosed. Seller shall provide such IP Disclosure to Buyer within two (2) months after Seller's inventor(s) first discloses the invention to Seller's person(s) responsible for intellectual property matters. Additionally, IP Disclosures provided by Seller to Buyer shall state whether Seller believes that the Project Intellectual Property being disclosed should be treated as proprietary, as a trade secret, or may be subject to
review by the U.S. Government in accordance with FAR clause 52.227-10. Pending response from Buyer, Seller shall protect such Project Intellectual Property accordingly, including all markings and other protections specified by the Prime Contract. Within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of Seller’s IP Disclosure, Buyer shall notify Seller whether Buyer requires Seller to continue such protection of the Project Intellectual Property or discontinue such protection as unnecessary.
Background Intellectual Property Rights. Each Party shall retain ownership of its Background Intellectual Property, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting a Party ownership rights to the other Party’s Background Intellectual Property. However, to the extent that it is necessary to perform the Project contemplated under this Agreement, Buyer hereby grants to Seller a non- exclusive, royalty-free, non-commercial license to use Buyer’s Background Intellectual Property, and Seller hereby grants to Buyer a non-exclusive, royalty- free, non-commercial license to use Seller’s Background Intellectual Property. Where the Parties determine that the commercialization and practice of Project Intellectual Property by one Party requires the use of Background Intellectual Property of the other Party, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith for the license rights which will allow the practice and commercialization of the results of the Project Intellectual Property.
The rights of the Parties to Project Intellectual Property made by their employees in the performance of this Agreement shall be further governed by the terms of the Prime Contract. The Prime Contract also grants the U. S. Government certain rights in the Project Intellectual Property.
Each Party hereto may use Project Intellectual Property of the other Party nonexclusively and without compensation in connection with research or development activities for the Project, including inclusion in project reports to the Prime Sponsor and proposals to the Prime Sponsor for continued funding of this Project through additional phases.
To the extent Seller has the legal right to do so, Buyer shall have an option to negotiate a commercial license(s) to the Project Intellectual Property of Seller, subject to any rights of the Prime Sponsor or U.S. Government therein.
DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION. In accepting this Agreement, Seller certifies that, to the best of its knowledge, it and its principals:
are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction by any Federal department or agency. Any change in the debarred or suspended status of Seller during the life of this Agreement must be reported immediately to Buyer.
have not within a three year period preceding this Agreement been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (federal, state, or local) transaction or contract under a public transaction, such as: violation of Federal law or State antitrust statutes or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property.
are not presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a government entity (federal, state or local) with commission of any of the offenses listed in paragraph (b) of this Article 19.
have not within a three-year period preceding this Agreement had one or more public transactions (federal, state, or local) terminated for cause or default.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION. The Parties must make every reasonable attempt to resolve in an amicable manner all disputes concerning the interpretation of this Agreement. If the Parties are unable to agree, then disputes shall be adjudicated through binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association. However, Seller shall proceed with the work under the SOW without interruption and without awaiting settlement of any such claim.
In the event of a dispute between the parties, the parties agree to negotiate a settlement in good faith.  Should this fail to resolve the dispute, the parties shall be free to pursue resolution through mediation where a mutually agreed upon neutral third party assists the disputants in reaching a negotiated settlement but has not authority to bind either party to any resolution.

52.219-14    LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACTING (DEVIATION 2021-O0008)	SEP/2021
This clause does not apply to the unrestricted portion of a partial set-aside.
Definition. Similarly situated entity, as used in this clause, means a first-tier subcontractor, including an independent contractor, that--
Has the same small business program status as that which qualified the prime contractor for the award (e.g., for a small business set-aside contract, any small business concern, without regard to its socioeconomic status); and
Is considered small for the size standard under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code the prime contractor assigned to the subcontract.
Applicability. This clause applies only to--
Contracts that have been set aside for any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3);
Part or parts of a multiple-award contract that have been set aside for any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3);
Contracts that have been awarded on a sole-source basis in accordance with subparts 19.8, 19.13, 19.14, and 19.15;
Orders expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and that are--
Set aside for small business concerns under multiple-award contracts, as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F); or
Issued directly to small business concerns under multiple-award contracts as described in 19.504(c)(1)(ii);
Orders, regardless of dollar value, that are--
Set aside in accordance with subparts 19.8, 19.13, 19.14, or 19.15 under multiple-award contracts, as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F); or
Issued directly to concerns that qualify for the programs described in subparts 19.8, 19.13, 19.14, or 19.15 under multiple-
award contracts, as described in 19.504(c)(1)(ii); and
Contracts using the HUBZone price evaluation preference to award to a HUBZone small business concern unless the concern waived the evaluation preference.
Independent contractors. An independent contractor shall be considered a subcontractor.
Limitations on subcontracting. By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Contractor agrees that in performance of a contract assigned a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for--
Services (except construction), it will not pay more than 50 percent of the amount paid by the Government for contract performance, excluding certain other direct costs and certain work performed outside the United States (see paragraph (e)(1)(i)), to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count towards the prime contractors 50 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the service portion of the contract. The following services may be excluded from the 50 percent limitation:
Other direct costs, to the extent they are not the principal purpose of the acquisition and small business concerns do not provide the service. Examples include airline travel, work performed by a transportation or disposal entity under a contract assigned the environmental remediation NAICS code 562910), cloud computing services, or mass media purchases.
Work performed outside the United States on awards made pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, or work performed outside the United States required to be performed by a local contractor.
Supplies (other than procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies), it will not pay more than 50 percent of the amount paid by the Government for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count towards the prime contractors 50 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. When a contract includes both supplies and services, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the supply portion of the contract;
General construction, it will not pay more than 85 percent of the amount paid by the Government for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count towards the prime contractors 85 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded; or
Construction by special trade contractors, it will not pay more than 75 percent of the amount paid by the Government for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count towards the prime contractors 75 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded.
The Contractor shall comply with the limitations on subcontracting as follows:
(1) For contracts, in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1), (2), (3) and (6) of this clause--
[  ] By the end of the base term of the contract and then by the end of each subsequent option period; or [  ] By the end of the performance period for each order issued under the contract.
(2) For orders, in accordance with paragraphs (c)(4) and (5) of this clause, by the end of the performance period for the order.

(End of clause)
52.227-11	PATENT RIGHTS--OWNERSHIP BY THE CONTRACTOR	MAY/2014
As used in this clause--
Invention means any invention or discovery that is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the U.S. Code, or any variety of plant that is or may be protectable under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et seq.)
Made means--
When used in relation to any invention other than a plant variety, the conception or first actual reduction to practice of the invention; or
When used in relation to a plant variety, that the Contractor has at least tentatively determined that the variety has been reproduced with recognized characteristics.
Nonprofit organization means a university or other institution of higher education or an organization of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)), or any nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified under a State nonprofit organization statute.
Practical application means to manufacture, in the case of a composition of product; to practice, in the case of a process or method; or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.
Subject invention means any invention of the Contractor made in the performance of work under this contract.
Contractor's rights. (1) Ownership. The Contractor may retain ownership of each subject invention throughout the world in accordance with the provisions of this clause.
(2) License. (i) The Contractor shall retain a nonexclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, unless the Contractor fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. The Contractor's license extends to any domestic subsidiaries and affiliates within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a part, and includes the right to grant sublicenses to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at contract award. The license is transferable only with the written approval of the agency, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
(ii) The Contractor's license may be revoked or modified by the agency to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention in a particular country in accordance with the procedures in FAR 27.302(i)(2) and 27.304-1(f).
Contractor's obligations. (1) The Contractor shall disclose in writing each subject invention to the Contracting Officer within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure shall identify the inventor(s) and this contract under which the subject invention was made. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding of the subject invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale (i.e., sale or offer for sale), or public use of the subject invention, or whether a manuscript describing the subject invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication. In addition, after disclosure to the agency, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the subject invention for publication and any on sale or public use.
The Contractor shall elect in writing whether or not to retain ownership of any subject invention by notifying the Contracting Officer within 2 years of disclosure to the agency. However, in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has
initiated the 1-year statutory period during which valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by the agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.
The Contractor shall file either a provisional or a nonprovisional patent application or a Plant Variety Protection Application on an elected subject invention within 1 year after election. However, in any case where a publication, on sale, or public use has initiated the 1-year statutory period during which valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States, the Contractor shall file the application prior to the end of that statutory period. If the Contractor files a provisional application, it shall file a nonprovisional application within 10 months of the filing of the provisional application. The Contractor shall file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either 10 months of the first filed patent application (whether provisional or nonprovisional) or 6 months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
The Contractor may request extensions of time for disclosure, election, or filing under paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this clause.
Government's rights--(1) Ownership. The Contractor shall assign to the agency, on written request, title to any subject invention--
If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect ownership to the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, or elects not to retain ownership; provided, that the agency may request title only within 60 days after learning of the Contractor's failure to disclose or elect within the specified times.
In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the agency, the Contractor shall continue to retain
ownership in that country.
In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.
(2) License. If the Contractor retains ownership of any subject invention, the Government shall have a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on its behalf, the subject invention throughout the world.
Contractor action to protect the Government's interest. (1) The Contractor shall execute or have executed and promptly deliver to the agency all instruments necessary to--
Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions in which the Contractor elects to retain ownership; and
Assign title to the agency when requested under paragraph (d) of this clause and to enable the Government to obtain patent protection and plant variety protection for that subject invention in any country.
The Contractor shall require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in the Contractor's format, each subject invention in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. The disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, as to the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any decisions not to file a nonprovisional patent application, continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response or filing period required by the relevant patent office.
The Contractor shall include, within the specification of any United States nonprovisional patent or plant variety protection application and any patent or plant variety protection certificate issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement, "This invention was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by (identify the agency). The Government has certain rights in the invention."
Reporting on utilization of subject inventions. The Contractor shall submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining utilization of the subject invention that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. The reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and other data and information as the agency may reasonably specify. The Contractor also shall provide additional reports as may be requested by the agency in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by the agency in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause. The Contractor also shall mark any utilization report as confidential/proprietary to help prevent inadvertent release outside the Government. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), the agency will not disclose that information to persons outside the Government without the Contractor's permission.
Preference for United States industry. Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, neither the Contractor nor any assignee shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless the person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for an agreement may be waived by the agency upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States, or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
March-in rights. The Contractor acknowledges that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has retained ownership, the agency has the right to require licensing pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210(c), and in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of the agency in effect on the date of contract award.
Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations. If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it shall--
Not assign rights to a subject invention in the United States without the written approval of the agency, except where an assignment is made to an organization that has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions, provided, that the assignee shall be subject to the same provisions as the Contractor;
Share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (but through their agency if the agency deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;
Use the balance of any royalties or income earned by the Contractor with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions for the support of scientific research or education; and
Make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business concerns, and give a preference to a small business concern when licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the small business concern has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business concerns; provided, that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business concern has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be
at the discretion of the Contractor.
Allow the Secretary of Commerce to review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when the Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of paragraph (i)(4) of this clause.
Communications. N/A
Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (k), in all subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed by a small business concern or nonprofit organization.
The Contractor shall include in all other subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work the substance of the patent rights clause required by FAR Subpart 27.3.
At all tiers, the patent rights clause must be modified to identify the parties as follows: references to the Government are not changed, and the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause. The Contractor shall not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.
In subcontracts, at any tier, the agency, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the agency with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes statute in connection with proceedings under paragraph (h) of this clause.
(End of clause)
252.235-7010	ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF SUPPORT AND DISCLAIMER	MAY/1995
The Contractor shall include an acknowledgment of the Government's support in the publication of any material based on or developed under this contract, stated in the following terms: This material is based upon work supported by the Army STTR Program Office under Contract No. W58RGZ-22-C-0048.
All material, except scientific articles or papers published in scientific journals, must, in addition to any notices or disclaimers by the Contractor, also contain the following disclaimer: Any opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the the Army STTR Program Office.

Limitation on charges for rights in technical data or computer software.
The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract when--
The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data or software; or
The data are available to the public without restrictions.
The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause--
Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier technical data or computer software, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and

The Contractor shall use the Technical DataCommercial Items clause of this contract to obtain technical data pertaining to commercial items, components, or processes. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.
Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.
In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.
